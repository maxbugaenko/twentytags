/**
 * Test injector parent class, abstract
 *
 * You should inherit this class and place your injector into
 * /test/injector/Injector.php. For more information about this concept,
 * read an article at fazend.com blog (link you can find below).
 *
 * You inherit your class from this one and define _init*() methods. All
 * of them will be called BEFORE unit tests and on every page click in the
 * "development" environment.
 *
 * This class is a good place for:
 *  - making automatic login of a test user
 *  - replacing real-life SOAP/RPC/REST proxies with mocks
 *  - turning logging ON in certain classes
 *  - turning some time-consuming functionality OFF
